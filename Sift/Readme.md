# Sift

Sift is a news agregator that brings together popular news sources, summarizes their articles and presents them in their simplest form.

This project experiments with flipped feed in which newer articles are placed at the bottom in order to help users continue to work towards the newest information.

Sift holds the reader's place in order for them to leave the app and check back later, continuing to get updated from where they last left off.

Sift uses python's Natural Language Toolkit to determine the most relevent sentences, hiding the others unless the user wants to get the whole story, in which case, shaking the phone unveils the original article.
