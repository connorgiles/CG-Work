# Dynamic Connection Consignee Confirmation Module

This node web service was built to help logistics dispatchers eliminate upwards of 60 phone calls a day.

Due to old legacy systems with minimal opportunity for expansion, I had to find a creative way to enable the team to do more with little effort.

This system accepts HTTP requests from an add-in for Outlook, creating an endpoint for clients to link to. Clients can then confirm successful delivery of their shipments, noting any discrepinsies or issues upon delivery. Operators have full visibility in to which emails have been delivered, opened and replied to, allowing them to work on creating more value.

This was built as a test module in order to prove the concept before integrating it in to a full transportation management system that was being constructed.
