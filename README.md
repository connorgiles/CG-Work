# CG-Work
A repository showcasing some of my work.

Here are three projects I enjoyed building:

[1. Sift](/sift) - A summarizing new agregotor for iOS

[2. pi-rfid-reader](/pi-rfid-reader) - My first exploration of hardware: a library and client code to interact with an RFID Reader over serial ports.

[3. Dynamic Connections](/dc-confirmation-module) Confirmation Module - A small web service I made at my previous job to dramatically improve operational efficiency.
